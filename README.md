This project is a simple web-based income tax calculator that helps users estimate their tax liability based on their gross annual income, extra income, age group, and applicable deductions.

##### Wonder how it Works? #####

Users  will input their gross annual income, any extra income they may have, their age group, and any applicable deductions. The calculator then computes their overall income after deductions and determines if they owe any tax.
which is actually determined based on their income itself as follows:-

==>If the overall income is under 8 Lakhs, no tax is owed.
==>If the overall income exceeds 8 Lakhs, the excess amount is taxed based on the user's age group.
